# PHP Sign up / Log in

This is a sign up and login system to practice PHP and MySQL. 

Features:
- Follows best practices with sanatising data to prevent SQL injection
- Hashes user passwords with bcrypt
- Gives feedback and fills in form if user submits incorrect data
- Connects to MySQL database and inserts rows for created users into a user table
- Follows MVC architecture

Improvements:
- There is currently no styling as the functionality is what I needed to practice
- The code is currently formatted in procedural PHP but it could be better as object oriented PHP
